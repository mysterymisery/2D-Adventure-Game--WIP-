# 2D-Adventure-Game--WIP-
Small 2D Adventure Game created with HTML OpenGl Canvas/images and JavaScript

This game is a WIP, I plan to add actual key controls, and randomization to spawns

Controls:
  The character (pickle man) is Controlled by pressing the buttons under the game Canvas that correspond to the desired movement
 
Objective:
  The game is won by killing all of the enemies or lost by the player dying
  To damage enemies you must attempt to move onto their position, and they damage you by doing the same
  They're are potions on the map tha will heal the player, however the player can pick them up even if they are at full health


Disclaimer:
This game was created using images off the internet as proof of concept, I DO NOT own the images that were used as the character/Potion sprites
The terrain was created using OpenGl primitives 

I hope that avoids any copyright issues or what not.
